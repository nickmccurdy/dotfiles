# Nick's config files for Linux/Unix software

## About
This is my castle (dotfile repo) for
[homeshick](https://github.com/andsens/homeshick), which makes it easier for me
to store and move around my config files with a git repo. Please note that my
install script installs homeshick for you, so you won't need to worry about
that. :)

## Installation
`wget -q https://raw.github.com/thenickperson/castle/master/Makefile && make`

## Older config files
- [My old fork of Cody Krieger's vim config files](https://github.com/thenickperson/dotvim-old)
